    "abstract": "This work is concerned with the question of how to combine online\n an ensemble of active learners so as to expedite the learning\n progress in pool-based active learning. We develop an\n active-learning master algorithm, based on a known competitive algorithm\n for the multi-armed bandit problem. A major challenge in\n successfully choosing top performing active learners online is to\n reliably estimate their progress during the learning session. To this\n end we propose a simple maximum entropy criterion that provides\n effective estimates in realistic settings. We study the\n performance of the proposed master algorithm using an ensemble\n containing two of the best known active-learning algorithms as\n well as a new algorithm. The resulting active-learning master\n algorithm is empirically shown to consistently perform almost as\n well as and sometimes outperform the best algorithm in the\n ensemble on a range of classification problems.",
