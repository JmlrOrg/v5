    "abstract": "We study the learnability of Probabilistic Deterministic Finite State Automata  under a modified PAC-learning criterion. \n We argue that it is\n necessary to add additional parameters to the sample complexity polynomial, namely \n a bound on the expected length of strings generated from any state, and a bound on the distinguishability between states.\n With this, we demonstrate that the class of PDFAs is PAC-learnable using a variant of a standard state-merging algorithm \n and the Kullback-Leibler divergence as error function.",
