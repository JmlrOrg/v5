    "abstract": "Prior knowledge, in the form of linear inequalities that need to be\nsatisfied over multiple polyhedral sets, is incorporated into a\nfunction approximation generated by a linear combination of linear or\nnonlinear kernels.  In addition, the approximation needs to satisfy\nconventional conditions such as having given exact or inexact function\nvalues at certain points.  Determining such an approximation leads to\na linear programming formulation. By using nonlinear kernels and\nmapping the prior polyhedral knowledge in the input space to one\ndefined by the kernels, the prior knowledge translates into nonlinear\ninequalities in the original input space. Through a number of\ncomputational examples, including a real world breast cancer prognosis\ndataset, it is shown that prior knowledge can significantly improve\nfunction approximation.",
