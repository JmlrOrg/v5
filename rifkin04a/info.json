    "abstract": "We consider the problem of multiclass classification.  Our main\n thesis is that a simple \"one-vs-all\" scheme is as accurate as\n any other approach, assuming that the underlying binary\n classifiers are well-tuned regularized classifiers such as support vector machines.\n This thesis is interesting in that it disagrees with a large body\n of recent published work on multiclass classification.  We support\n our position by means of a critical review of the existing\n literature, a substantial collection of carefully controlled experimental\n work, and theoretical arguments.",
